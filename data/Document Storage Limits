Document Storage Limits
Your Files In HR Partner
We allow you to store document files in HR Partner, either as  Employee Files, which are attached to individual employees, or as Library Files, which are available company wide.

These files do take up space on our servers, so depending on your plan, please be aware that there is a limited amount of disk space available to you.

You can always check the space available on your plan by looking at the bottom right corner of every HR Partner screen.



Just under the purple icon (that you can click on at any time to talk to our support team), you will see a display of how much space you have used, and how much your limit is.

Once you have reached your limit, you can no longer upload any new documents to HR Partner.

Increasing Your Storage Limit
The simplest way to increase your storage limit is to upgrade to another, bigger plan.  This will change the subscription price you pay each month, but as you move up to bigger plans, your storage limit will vastly increase.  Lots of our customer upgrade to a 50 or 75 employee plan, even though they have far less employees - purely for the increased storage limit.

Under special circumstances, we can adjust the storage limit on a case by case basis, should there be a good reason.  You can always talk to us (via the support icon) to discuss your needs.
